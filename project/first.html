			<h1> Your First Visit!</h1>
			<p> If you are new to our practice, we look forward to meeting you and your pet(s)
			and want to make sure your visit is comfortable and pleasant. We work by appointment
			in order to minimize wait times and to provide as much time as needed to assess
			and treat every patient. Our client services team will be happy to assist you in scheduling
			a convenient appointment time.</p>
			
			<p>We strongly recomment pet carriers for cats (and some smaller dogs) and leashes
			for dogs. The street and parking lot can be busy and pets may get very excited by all the activity.
			If other pets bother your pet, let the client services team know in advance and we can minimize or eliminate
			the time your pet spends in our reception area.</p>
			
			<p>During the examination and treatment of your pet, a member of the nursing team will
			assist the doctor. They are trained to safely and comfortably restrain
			your pet. Most pets will respond better to restraint by someone other than the owner.
			It works best when the owner remains relaxed and in view of the patient during the 
			examination.</p>
			
			<p>After your appointment, our staff can check you out either at the reception counter,
			or in the exam room. They are also happy to assist getting your pets to and from your car.
			
			St. Francis Hospital for Animals has grown and thrived on the goodwill and satisfaction
			of our clients. We would greatly appreciate your feedback. You encourage you to do this on our
			website. Simply slick on "Reviews" and take a moment and read what our clients have said
			about their time in our practice and let us know how we are doing.
