		<h2> Site intent</h2>

			<p>The objective of this redesign is to make this site more modern looking and
			 also to get rid of un needed information. While making the site look good we
			 will also make it more user friendly.</p>

			<p>By reducing the information not only will make the site look cleaner and 
			more organized, it will also get right to the point on each page and section.
			All of this content reduction will also make that site load up much faster.</p>

		<h2>Targeted audience </h2>

			<p> Our target audience is going to be females who's age range from 20's to 60's.
			From 20's to 30's are going to be most likely females who live alone or have a
			husband/boyfriend that doesn't like to take the pet to the vet. They will most 
			likely have kids that love their pets and would want to make sure their pet is 
			always as healthy as possible.</p>

			<p> Ladies from their 40's to 60's are most likely be more solitary type of 
			couples that basically see their pets as their own son/daughter. Older people 
			are not too much into technology and that is why we will make sure we make this
			site really easy to navigate through and have everything right to the point.</p>
